# Solving-Problems-with-Python
During the challenge I analysed 6 obfuscated Python Scripts and produced a short report describing:
1. What the Python programs are designed to do
2. The process and methods you used when reverse engineering the program
3. What, if any, techniques or tricks were used by the program to make reverse engineering more difficult
